### Chapter 7 - Xbox Cloud Gaming

Xbox Cloud Gaming, aka xCloud, is a streaming service offered by Microsoft, provided by their Azure cloud datacenters. Like other cloud gaming providers, this service is unique in that it offers a number of Xbox exclusive titles that can be streamed either to an Xbox Series S or X console, or to a variety of devices, including Android, iOS, macOS and ChromeOS.

xCloud also allows you to stream games on your Xbox One or Xbox Series consoles without downloading the full game. The Game Pass Ultimate membership provides either option. The streaming option on your Xbox and big screen TV allows you to jump into a multiplayer game from your couch without waiting for the download. Streaming also allows you to try out a game before committing to a full hours-long download.

## Hardware

### Datacenters

One of Microsoft's main sources of revenue comes from it's cloud offering, known as Azure. Similar to Amazon's AWS or Google's Cloud Platform, Azure powers a large portion of the public and private Internet. In 2018 Azure had 54 operating or announced regions across the world. Adding Xbox hardware to their own datacenters to run alongside other compute and video streaming services makes sense for the Xbox hardware and software teams.

Initially launched on rack-mounted Xbox One S hardware back in 2018, Project xCloud promised game streaming to a variety devices. Even then, cross-platform play was something xCloud wanted to deliver. In 2021, they announced that the backend Xbox hardware had been upgraded to custom Xbox Series X hardware, which provides better load times, frame rates, and access to games that are optimized to run on the publicly available Series X hardware.

### User

All xCloud games work with Xbox controllers, whether the user is on an Xbox or some other hardware. For touch screens, some games have been modified to draw touch-based controls on-screen and eliminate the need for a separate controller.

## Experience

I've been playing [Snow Runner](https://www.focus-entmt.com/en-us/games/snowrunner) on xCloud. I have an Xbox One X at home hooked up to a 4k 65 inch TV. Half of the time I play Snow Runner in front of the 4k TV and the other half I've spent in front of my 2020 13 inch MacBook Pro with an Intel chipset. Game saves are nearly seamless - on xCloud it loads seamlessly and is quick. When I play on xCloud and then switch back to my downloaded copy of the game on the One X, the game needs to restart, which can take a few minutes because the One X has a regular hard disk drive, not a faster solid state drive.

I've played the xCloud version for hours at a time. The downsides are occasional lag which, depending on what I'm doing in the game at the time, can cause me to drive off of the road. This usually corrects itself after a few seconds. I opened the macOS Activity Monitor to the Network tab and watched it for about an hour while playing and it appeared to use around 6 Gb per hour. Some of these Xbox Series X/S games are nearly a 100 Gb download, so if data caps are a concern with your broadband service, you would be better off downloading the game to an Xbox if you're going to play on xCloud for more than 15 hours a month.

## Pricing

xCloud requires an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership at $14.99 USD/month. This membership includes new titles on release day.
