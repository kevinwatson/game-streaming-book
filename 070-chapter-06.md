### Chapter 6 - Amazon Luna

## Hardware

### Datacenters

Luna uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) G4 instances which are powered by NVIDIA T4 graphics processing units (GPU) hardware. G4 instances are available with either Windows or Linux preinstalled, and it appears that Luna is running on one or the other, rather than running on custom Xbox or PlayStation hardware like other cloud gaming offerings.

### User

Users can purchase the Luna Controller sold by Amazon for $69.99 USD. The controller features a Wi-Fi connection, which connects directly to Amazon's game servers through your network to reduce latency. PlayStation and Xbox controllers can also be used to connect to your device via BlueTooth and then to the game servers.

Luna works on Amazon Fire TVs, Fire TV devides, Fire Tablets, Android 9+, PC, Mac, Chromebook, iPhone and iPad.

## Experience

## Pricing

Luna costs $5.99 USD per month, with an optional Ubisoft+ add on for $14.99 per month which gives users access to new Ubisoft titles on release day.
